Use this trivial site to check if your students can find trival passwords or simple passwords people usually use.

Common passwords and safe-unsafe protocols for password creations should be taught BEFORE the use of this site, else students might be discouraged not finding the passwords. Provide them with a text file or a handout on the most common passwords to search for.
