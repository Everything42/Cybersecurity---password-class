Use this trivial site to check if your students can find simple passwords people usually use.

The "Leaked Data" file provides them with supposedly stolen data of users that can be used to extrapolate some of their passwords. Should be given exactly before accessing the site.

Common passwords and safe-unsafe protocols for password creations should be taught BEFORE the use of this site, else students might be discouraged not finding the passwords. Also provide them with a text file or a handout on the most common passwords to search for.
